4.2  Motivation 
 
 
  
4.3 Problem Statement  
 
 
 ONLINE MATRIMONIAL SYSTEM (http://mazituzijodi.com/) designed for to overcome those problems using manual system such as the possibility the paper order is high. Customer can find many profile at on floor and can be match with her/his profile  . Customer can login to the system to maintain his account information, such as changing phone number, address, and check the status of his orders. 
 	 
 Therefore, ONLINE MATRIMONIAL SYSTEM (http://mazituzijodi.com/) developed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of taking order. Besides that, conventional system cannot see the history/matchprofile/complete biodata etc. therefore ONLINE MATRIMONIAL SYSTEM (http://mazituzijodi.com/) designed to view all.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                        4.4 Purpose/Objective & Goals  
 
A goal is an achievable outcome that is generally broad and longer term while an objective is shorter term and defines measurable actions to achieve an overall goal. While different, the two terms are often used in unison when working on a project. This is because both are essential to planning and executing a project 
 
Project objectives are what you plan to achieve by the end of your project. This might include deliverables and assets, or more intangible objectives like increasing productivity or motivation. Your project objectives should be attainable, time-bound, specific goals you can measure at the end of your project. 
        4.5 Project Scope & Limitation 
 
 
 
 
                 Due to manual system has following limitations: 
 
	In the existing system it is very difficult to match bride and groom  
	There is no computer system for handling payments. All calculations performed manually, which may not be accurate always maintaining the record is really a tedious task. 
	Searching is very difficult, not even found so many profile at time   
                 5 System Analysis 
 
It is a process of collecting and interpreting facts, identifying the problems, and decomposition of a system into its components. 
System analysis is conducted for the purpose of studying a system or its parts in order to identify its objectives. It is a problem-solving technique that improves the system and ensures that all the components of the system work efficiently to accomplish their purpose. 
Analysis specifies what the system should do. 


      Steps of Agile System Analysis Process 
 
1.	Identify System Users 
2.	Define Main Users Goals. ... 
3.	Define System Usage Patterns. ... 
4.	Invent Functional Solution to Meet Users Goals and Usage Patterns. ... 
5.	Define Main Navigation Paths. ... 
6.	Create UI Mock-ups. ... 
7.	Polish UI Elements. 
5.1 Comparative Study of Existing            
                       System 




The existing system was an automated system, but it was found to be inefficient in meeting the growing demands of population and different online matrimonial take a lot of time and money for searching a suitable match. But still, they are not able to provide a good life partner of any country, religion, caste and profession 
5.2 Scope & Limitation of Existing  
 
  
	Online search for bride or groom with area, cost etc anywhere or without wasting time. 
	Bride, Groom matching profile. So many profiles on one website  
	Customer can Match couple online and view the details of candidate. 
	Customer Manage his/her account online he can change his address or change the password. 
	Admin can manage all profile, payment history and detail     
                            
 
 
 
 
 
 
                     5.3 Project Perspective, features   
 
There exist at least two different perspectives on projects and project work. The traditional and the dominant perspective is the task perspective: It focuses on the work or the task itself; it is a perspective of those executing the project's activities and uses a rational approach. 
 
 
   Features: - 
 
	Time: Complete by March 2017 
	Quality: Minimize disruption to productivity 
	Cost: Not spend more than $125,000 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                  5.4 Stakeholders 
 
 
Stakeholder engagement is a critical aspect in a project lifecycle. A project performance report plays a significant role in determining the end results of a project. Whether or not a project met the desired objectives is determined by looking at the project performance report. When a project ends, few basic questions needs to be answered to stakeholders such as, ‘Is the project successful?’, ‘What could have been better?’, ‘Is the team efficient enough’? ‘Is the cost justified?’ In order to have answers to the above questions, you should have appropriate data to back up the story you want stakeholders to know. Therefore, it is necessary to have a mechanism in place to measure the success or failure of a project. A project reports an approved performance communication plan outlining the key project information which concerns project costs, quality, profit, risks, and areas of improvement. 
      
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.5 Requirement Analysis  
 
a) Functional Requirements  
This section provides requirement overview of the system. Various functional                modules that can implemented by the system 
1.	Registration - 
If customer wants to order the Jewelry item then he/she must be register. Unregister customer cannot buy the product.  
 
2.	Login - 
Customer logins to the system by entering valid user id and password for order the jewelry products online. 
 
3.	Update to profile - 
Update to profile means the customer after login or registration can use website or stop (when found correct life partner).   
 
5.	Logout -  
Candidate can anytime log out. 
 
6.	Report Generation - 
After all transaction, the system can generate the portable document file (.pdf) and then sent one copy to the system database to calculate the monthly search history. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Performance Requirements: - Performance requirements define how well the software system accomplishes certain functions under specific conditions. Examples include the software's speed of response, throughput, execution time and storage capacity. The service levels comprising performance requirements are often based on supporting end-user tasks. 
 
b) Security Requirements: -  
	Authentication and password management. 
	Authorization and role management. 
	Audit logging and analysis. 
	Network and data security. 
	Code integrity and validation testing. 
	Cryptography and key management. 
	Data validation and sanitization. 
  
 
                       6. System Design 
 
System design is the phase that bridges the gap between problem domain and the existing system in a manageable way. This phase focuses on the solution domain, i.e. “how to implement?” 
It is the phase where the SRS document is converted into a format that can be implemented and decides how the system will operate. 
In this phase, the complex activity of system development is divided into several smaller sub-activities, which coordinate with each other to achieve the main objective of system development. 
 
Inputs to System Design 
System design takes the following inputs − 
•	Statement of work 
•	Requirement determination plan 
•	Current situation analysis 
•	Proposed system requirements including a conceptual data model, modified DFDs, and Metadata (data about data). 
Outputs for System Design 
System design gives the following outputs − 
•	Infrastructure and organizational changes for the proposed system. 
•	A data schema, often a relational schema. 
•	Metadata to define the tables/files and columns/data-items. 
•	A function hierarchy diagram or web page map that graphically describes the program structure. 
•	Actual or pseudocode for each module in the program. 
 
 
                6.1 Design Constraints 
  
Design constraints are conditions that need to happen for a project to be successful. Design constraints help narrow choices when creating a project. In our example, at first any food in the entire world might be on your menu, but then you remember your budget and the choices get smaller. Design constraints can feel like a negative thing sometimes, but they help shape the project to fit the exact needs of the client. In this example, the result at the end of all your considerations will be a meal that suits you and all your guests. 
Instead of building a menu, we're going to learn how design constraints affect engineering projects like creating cars, buildings, and other structures. Let's look at some common constraints on these types of projects.

      6.9 Test procedure & Implementation 
 
 
 
1.	Unit Testing 
Unit testing concentrates verification on the smallest element of the program – the module.  Using the detailed design description important control paths are tested to establish errors within the bounds of the module. 
In the system each sub module is tested individually as per the unit testing such as campaign, lead, contact etc. are tested individually. Their input field validations are tested. 
2.	Integration testing  
Once all the individual units have been tested there is a need to test how they were put together to ensure no data is lost across interface, one module does not have an adverse impact on another and a function is not performed correctly.  
   After unit, testing each sub module is tested with integrating each other.

        7. Implementation details 
 
 Project implementation is the process of putting a project plan into action to produce the deliverables, otherwise known as the products or services, for clients or stakeholders. It takes place after the planning phase, during which a team determines the key objectives for the project, as well as the timeline and budget. Implementation involves coordinating resources and measuring performance to ensure the project remains within its expected scope and budget. It also involves handling any unforeseen issues in a way that keeps a project running smoothly. To implement a project effectively, project managers must consistently communicate with a team to set and adjust priorities as needed while maintaining transparency about the project's status with the clients or any key stakeholders.

                          8.Testing   
 
1)	Test Plan  
Test cases are built around specifications and requirements, i.e., what the application is supposed to do. Test cases are generally derived from external descriptions of the software, including specifications, requirements and design parameters. Although the tests used are primarily functional in nature, non-functional tests may also be used. The test designer selects both valid and invalid inputs and determines the correct output without any knowledge of the test object's i nternal structure. 
 
2)	Black box testing  
Black Box Testing is a software testing method in which the functionalities of software applications are tested without having knowledge of internal code structure, implementation details and internal paths. Black Box Testing mainly focuses on input and output of software applications and it is entirely based on software requirements and specifications. It is also known as Behavioral Testing. 
 
3)	White Box Testing  
White box testing techniques analyze the internal structures the used data structures, internal design, code structure and the working of the software rather than just the functionality as in black box testing. It is also called glass box testing or clear box testing or structural testing. 
 
  
 
 
Working process of white box testing: 
 Input: Requirements, Functional specifications, design documents, source code. 
Processing: Performing risk analysis for guiding through the entire process. 
 Proper test planning: Designing test cases so as to cover entire code. Execute rinse-repeat until error-free software is reached. Also, the results are communicated. 
Output: Preparing final report of the entire testing process.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                   9. Limitation 
 
 
	The disadvantage of this application is that it doesn’t allow the interested individuals to chat. 
	This leads to sharing of critical information like Contact no, Address and other personal details.
